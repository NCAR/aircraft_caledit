# aircraft_caledit
EOL/RAF aircraft calibration editor

The calibration editor has a few functions.  
 1) sweep calibrations off the aircraft alibrations database and into a database inhouse (moved to rosetta DEC 1, 2023).
 2) view calibrations and export them to nidas cal files.
 3) calibrations can be duplicated and then edited if need before exporting.  Original cals from the aircraft can not be edited (paper trail).
